# üëã Hello, I‚Äôm Phuvatat (a.k.a. PhuvatatDev)

I‚Äôm a self-taught developer with a clear goal:  
üß≠ **To build a stable and meaningful life through code, freedom, and creativity.**

## üå± About me
I‚Äôm not here to become a ‚Äúcode machine.‚Äù  
I‚Äôm here to learn, to grow, and to create **things that matter** ‚Äî for myself, for others, and for the life I want to live.

Based in Thailand üáπüá≠, I‚Äôm building a path that combines:
- üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personal freedom & financial stability
- üß† Constant learning in tech (especially Flutter, Firebase, and Clean Architecture)
- üí° Projects with purpose, not just ‚Äúapps to code‚Äù
- ‚ù§Ô∏è A human vision of success ‚Äî with space for love, travel, and meaningful work

## üí≠ My mindset
I believe in:
- Progress over perfection.
- Simplicity over complexity.
- Depth over speed.
- Being real, not just impressive.

My dream is to work from anywhere, stay rooted in my values, and help others through the things I create.
