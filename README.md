👋 Hi, I'm Phuvatat Szentessy — aka PVTDev  
Flutter Developer | AI-Augmented Product Builder  
Specialized in wellness, coaching, and local business apps  

---

🧘 My Focus  
I design and build **mobile applications for wellness, coaching, and small businesses**.  
From journaling and tarot to booking systems and customer engagement,  
I create apps that bring real value to people’s daily lives.  

---

🧠 My Mindset  
Build with purpose. Learn through action. Grow every day.  

I believe in:  
🚀 Taking action immediately — Progress starts by doing.  
🌍 Solving meaningful problems — Wellness & productivity apps that matter.  
🤖 Leveraging AI with intention — Claude Code & prompt engineering as core tools.  
📓 Documenting my journey — Sharing lessons openly.  
🤝 Growing with a strong network — Success comes faster with mentors and peers.  

---

🎯 Current Focus  
- Building production-ready **Flutter + Firebase apps** for wellness & coaching  
- Structuring scalable systems with **Clean Architecture**  
- Integrating **AI-assisted workflows** for faster delivery  
- Designing user journeys that feel natural and engaging  
- Understanding the **business impact** of every feature  

---

🌱 What I'm Working On  
- 🚀 Preparing the launch of **MindTarot** (my first public product)  
- Expanding backend expertise (Supabase, Node.js, PostgreSQL)  
- Refining AI prompting to push Claude Code to its limits  
- Exploring new ways to merge **tech + human growth**
