# 👋 Hello, I’m Phuvatat (a.k.a. PhuvatatDev)

I’m a self-taught developer with a clear goal:  
🧭 **To build a stable and meaningful life through code, freedom, and creativity.**

## 🌱 About me
I’m not here to become a “code machine.”  
I’m here to learn, to grow, and to create **things that matter** — for myself, for others, and for the life I want to live.

Based in Thailand 🇹🇭, I’m building a path that combines:
- 🧘‍♂️ Personal freedom & financial stability
- 🧠 Constant learning in tech (especially Flutter, Firebase, and Clean Architecture)
- 💡 Projects with purpose, not just “apps to code”
- ❤️ A human vision of success — with space for love, travel, and meaningful work

## 💭 My mindset
I believe in:
- Progress over perfection.
- Simplicity over complexity.
- Depth over speed.
- Being real, not just impressive.

My dream is to work from anywhere, stay rooted in my values, and help others through the things I create.
