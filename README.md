# 👋 Hi, I'm **Phuvatat Szentessy** — aka **PVTDev**  

**Flutter Developer** | **Prompt Engineer** | **AI-Augmented Builder**  
Building production-ready mobile applications with **Clean Architecture**, **AI-assisted development**, and a deep understanding of real-world problem solving.

## 🧠 My Mindset  
**Build with purpose. Learn through action. Grow every day.**  

I believe in:  
- 🚀 **Taking action immediately** — Progress starts by doing, not waiting.  
- 🌍 **Solving real-world problems** — I focus on meaningful applications.  
- 🛠 **Learning by building** — Improvement comes from creating and iterating.  
- 🎯 **Deep specialization** — Mastery in core technologies over chasing trends.  
- 🤖 **Leveraging AI with intention** — Using Claude Code and prompt engineering as core tools.  
- 📓 **Documenting my journey** — Sharing lessons and projects openly.  
- 🤝 **Growing with a strong network** — Success comes faster with mentors and peers.

## 🎯 Current Focus  
- Structuring scalable apps with **Clean Architecture** (Flutter + Firebase/Supabase)  
- Building **production-ready applications** from day one  
- Expert debugging, **system thinking**, and long-term maintainability  
- Mastering **Claude Code** for AI-native development workflows  
- Designing efficient **prompts** to guide AI like a real teammate  
- Understanding the **business impact** of what I build  

---

## 🌱 What I'm Working On  
- Preparing my **first product launch** (mobile app, V1 production-ready)  
- Expanding backend knowledge (**Supabase, Node.js, PostgreSQL**)  
- Improving daily through **real-world practice**, challenges, and rapid iteration  
- Refining my **prompt engineering** techniques to push AI to its limits
